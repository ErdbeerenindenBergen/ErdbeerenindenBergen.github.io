How did the daughter of a coal miner from a tiny, formerly industrial town in West Virginia become a bilingual cultural scholar and aspiring software developer who attends cybersecurity panels at NATO headquarters? The simple answer is: an unquenchable curiosity about everything, a love of languages and learning, and most importantly, persistence. Iâ€™ve been writing for as long as I can remember: songs as a performer, restaurant orders as a server, lesson plans as a teacher, poetry for Harvard, research for Oxford. But it's taken me a long time to find my calling: writing code.",
